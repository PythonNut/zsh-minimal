zsh-minimal
==========

An almost literate zsh config, targeted at:

* Machines that are slow, and cannot handle the full [zsh-config](http://github.com/PythonNut/zsh-config).
* Root accounts, where magic can be very dangerous
* Remote machines, where network bits are precious
* People who like minimalism
